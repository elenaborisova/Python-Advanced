## **05.	Word Count -** [Solution](https://github.com/elenaborisova/Python-Advanced/blob/main/11.%20File%20Handling%20-%20Lab/05_word_count.py)
Write a program that reads a list of words from the file words.txt and finds how many times each of the words is contained in another file text.txt. Matching should be case-insensitive.

The results should be written to another text files. Sort the words by frequency in descending order.

*Examples*

|     words.txt     |     text.txt      |     output.txt     |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------| 
|quick is fault     |-I was quick to judge him, but it wasn't his fault.<br>-Is this some kind of joke?! Is it?<br>-Quick, hide here...It is safer.    |is - 3<br>quick - 2<br>fault - 1          |
